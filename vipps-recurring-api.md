# HTTP responses

This API returns the following HTTP statuses in the responses:

| HTTP status         | Description                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `200 OK`            | Request successful                          |
| `201 Created`       | Request successful, resource created        |

| `401 Unauthorized`  | Invalid credentials                         |
| `403 Forbidden`     | Authentication ok, but credentials lacks authorization  |
| `404 Not Found`     | The resource was not found  |

| `500 Server Error`  | An internal Vipps problem.                  |

All error responses contains an `error` object in the body, with details of the problem.

\*: The limit is cautiously set quite low in the production environment, as we want to
monitor performance closely before increasing the limit.
We count HTTP requests per `client_id` and product (ISP and IPP).
For now, all HTTP requests are counted and rate-limited.
We have previously requested data from integrators about volume, times, etc,
but only received this from one integrator.
If you are able to provide data for your solution, please let us know.

# Authentication and authorization

Vipps has to ensure compliance with governing regulations, including
[GDPR](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en).
This means that we have to make sure that Vipps:

* Does not provide information about client, explicitly or implicitly, to unauthorised entities.
* Does not store information accidentally received, which we are not authorised to see.
* Propagate changes quickly if a user opts out or in to Vipps Recurring.
* Does not store personal information, i.e. invoices, which we do not have the right to see.

## API access token

The first thing that is required is to get the access token to the API. This is described
in the [external documentation section](#external-documentation).

Shortly summarized, you will have to make the following request
(`client_id`, `client_secret` and `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` placeholders must be replaced with real values):

```http
POST https://apitest.vipps.no/api/access-token/jwt-token HTTP/1.1
Host: apitest.vipps.no
Content-Type: application/json
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key>

{
	"client_id":"<client_id>",
	"client_secret":"<client_secret>",
	"resource":"https://testapivipps.no/7abc8823-85cc-4549-bb98-698233625162"
}

```



The request above will return a response similar to this, with the `access_token`:

```http
HTTP 200 OK
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": "86398",
  "ext_expires_in": "0",
  "expires_on": "1495271273",
  "not_before": "1495184574",
  "resource": "00000002-0000-0000-c000-000000000000",
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1Ni <continued>"
}
```

Every request to the API, , needs to have an `Authorization` header with the generated token.

The header in the request to this API should look like this:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1Ni <continued>
```

## Typical flow

1. A user requests a subscription from the merchant.

2. An agreement is sent with [`POST:/api/v1/draftAgreement`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/draft-agreement-controller/registerUsingPOST). In the  respons is a "agreementResource" field that can be used in step 4.

3. The user approves the agreement.

4. The Merchant retrieves the agreement status. Either by getting all agreements
 [`GET:/api/v1/agreement`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/agreement-controller/listUsingGET) or the specific agreement
 [`GET:/api/v1/agreement/{agreementId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/agreement-controller/getUsingGET) per now we do not send callback when the user accepts.

5. The merchant is now free to post charges to the given charge using [`POST:/api/v1/charge/{agreementId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/charge-controller/createUsingPOST)

6. Later a merchant might want to check if a user has any failed charges and therefore terminate the subscription. This can be done by getting all charges on the users agreement on  [`GET:/api/v1/charge/{agreementId}`](https://vippsas.github.io/vipps-recurring-api/#/charge-controller/listUsingGET_1)
